# crypto-resolver

A lightweight Node.js package for resolving cryptocurrency names and tickers to their CoinGecko IDs and vice versa, leveraging the CoinGecko API. Perfect for developers working with cryptocurrency data who need a reliable way to translate between different identifiers.

## Features

- **Name to ID Resolution**: Convert cryptocurrency names or tickers to their unique CoinGecko IDs.
- **ID to Name Resolution**: Convert CoinGecko IDs back to cryptocurrency names and tickers.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick and efficient performance.
- **Easy to Use**: Designed with simplicity in mind for developers of all skill levels.

## Installation

Install `crypto-resolver` using npm:

```bash
npm install crypto-resolver
```

Or yarn:

```bash
yarn add crypto-resolver
```

## Usage

First, import and initialize the `CryptoResolver` class:

```javascript
const CryptoResolver = require('crypto-resolver');
const resolver = new CryptoResolver();
```

Before using the resolver, ensure you initialize it to fetch the latest cryptocurrency data:

```javascript
async function initialize() {
  await resolver.init();
}

initialize();
```

### Resolving Name or Ticker to CoinGecko ID

```javascript
async function resolveNameOrTicker() {
  const id = await resolver.resolveNameOrTickerToId('btc');
  console.log(`The CoinGecko ID for BTC is ${id}`);
}

resolveNameOrTicker();
```

### Resolving CoinGecko ID to Name and Ticker

```javascript
async function resolveIdToNameAndTicker() {
  const info = await resolver.resolveIdToNameAndTicker('bitcoin');
  console.log(`Name: ${info.name}, Ticker: ${info.ticker}`);
}

resolveIdToNameAndTicker();
```
